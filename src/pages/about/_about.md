excerpt: "About this blog"

I am a front-end engineer. Currently open to collaboration, discussion and remote work.

This blog is a collection of links about programming that I find interesting. By sharing it with you, I hope to attract other people with similar tastes who will share the new link with me, at the same time hope it will be of use.

For now, I intend to randomly publish new blog posts. I've put together enough ideas for posts that I can maintain the blog for at least a few months at that pace to bootstrap and build a collection of material that will attract like-minded readers to help grow it.

Blog name, **Natserract**. New material submissions to my current email address, [alfins132@gmail.com](mailto:alfins132@gmail.com) are always welcome.

Hired me! [alfins132@gmail.com](mailto:alfins132@gmail.com)
