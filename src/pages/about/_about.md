For now, I intend to randomly publish new blog posts. I've put together enough ideas for posts that I can maintain the blog for at least a few months at that pace to bootstrap and build a collection of material that will attract like-minded readers to help grow it.

Blog name, **Natserract**. New material submissions to my current email address, [alfins132@gmail.com](mailto:alfins132@gmail.com) are always welcome. Hired me! [alfins132@gmail.com](mailto:alfins132@gmail.com)

This website is built with Next.js and hosted on Vercel. It's [open source](https://github.com/natserract/natserract-blog).
